    <h1 class="titulo5">Prebuilt & handmade coils for vaping
        <p class="titulo__intro">Coils play a key element to your vaping experience, where it helps to turn e-liquid
            into
            vapor and holds the most running costs. If you are new to the vaping arena, then this vape coils guide is
            likely
            to help you, have a better understanding of vaping coils.

            We are going to touch on vaping coils, types of coils, materials used in making vaping coils, and how it can
            impact your vaping experience. Prebuilt or handmade coils, it's all in here.
        </p>
    </h1>

    <h2 class="kanthal">kanthal
        <p>Kanthal is primarily used in e-cigarette vape coils for variable wattage or variable voltage vaping. This
            material consists of a mixture of iron, aluminum, and chromium that can resist higher temperatures.

            It is a great option among vapers because its taste doesn't change with increased heat. Thus, you can use
            this
            material for a wide variety of wattages. You can easily use this material for building personalized coils
            that
            can be manipulated and fit for any vaping device.

            But if you wondered why you see Kanthal vape coils on nearly every vape kit - this is why. Mr Versatile.

    </h2>

    <h3 class="nichrome">Nichrome
        <p>We arrive upon, NICHROME - the vaping wire choice of temperature control fans. Nichrome wire is a composition
            of chromium and nickel that can heat up faster than Kanthal. It helps in producing larger amounts of clouds,
            flavors, and a warm vape. Nichrome vaping wire was used mainly during the early vaping days.

            It doesn't change it's resistance power with rising temperatures and offers reliable vaping. This means it's
            generally favoured where dry hits and hot spot burnouts, are aiming to be avoided.

            That said, is anyone ever aiming to not avoid a dry hit?

            Although Nichrome doesn't add to the temperature control vaping, it can support temperatures based on
            vaper's settings. It is one of the more popular forms of mod style vaping used by vapers with fast ramp-up
            times and life span of coil life.

    </h3>

    <h4 class="nickel">Nickel
        <p>Nickel vaping coils contain a pure form of nickel that is used for temperature control. Since it's resistance
            changes more than Nichrome and Kanthal when heated up, it is only used in TC modes, where it can easily
            detect changes and infer temperature accordingly.

            Due to its low resistance, several Temp Control vape settings tend to work better with straight nickel wire,
            other available materials. Besides, nickel coils don't last for a long time when dry fired. It is also not
            suitable for variable wattage and variable voltage vaping. It can be an allergen to some vapers, so read
            this vape coils guide carefully to avoid unexpected risks.

    </h4>

    <h5 class="ss">Stainless steel 
        <p>SS or stainless steel is the most versatile coil type available in the market and is suitable for both
            variable wattage/variable voltage and temperature control modes.

            It is a combination of chromium, carbon, and nickel components without creating any nickel allergens.
            Stainless steel can resist dry firing due to its high melting point and easily hold shapes perfectly. It is
            easy to work with and provides a faster ramp-up time like that of Kanthal. It helps to produce clean flavor
            and consists of magnetic properties that boost its longevity.

            So if it's conventional style vaping your are after, kanthal is a shout for your wire, but so is Stainless
            Steel.
