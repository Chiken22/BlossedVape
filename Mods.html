    <p class="aegis__text">Geekvape Legend 2 [Editors Choice]
        <br>
        The Geekvape Aegis Legend 2 (or L200) kit is the latest kit from long-time popular
        manufacturer Geekvape. By now most vapers know who they are as they’ve made some great products over the
        years. Too many to list here, but they’re a very solid and reliable company overall. The L200 is the latest
        in a long line of Aegis products that started with the original Legend—one of the first, if not the first
        IP67 water and shock-resistant vape mod.

        Since then, they have had many products in that line, with the most recent being the Aegis Legend and Aegis
        X mods and the line of Aegis pods. The L200 has a lot of similarities to the original Legend, but it is now
        IP68 rated for extra durability. It’s a 200-watt rated mod with a dual-18650 battery configuration and comes
        in a kit with the Z sub ohm tank.
        <br>
        Price: $52.95 only mod - 73.95 KIT (with tank) (at Direct Vapor)
        <br>
        Colors: Silver with grey leather, Grey with green leather, Black with brown leather, and more.</p>

    <p class="drag__text">Voopoo Drag 3 (Best selling mod)
        <br>
        The Voopoo Drag 3 is the newest addition to the ever popular Drag family of vape mods. It all started with
        the original Drag which quickly gained a reputation as a solid and reliable dual battery mod. Since then,
        Voopoo has released the Drag 2 and Drag Mini mods, the Drag Nano pod vape, and the Drag X, Drag S, and Drag
        Max pod mods. No matter how you want to vape, there’s a “Drag” mod for you.
        The Drag 3 marks Voopoo’s first return to a dual battery 510 mod since the Argus GT of last year. It takes
        two 18650 batteries and uses the Gene.Fan 2.0 chipset to fire at up to 177W. The kit comes with the TPP Tank
        and a 510 adapter that allows it to be used on the Drag 3 and any other mod with a 510 connection. This TPP
        Tank is also compatible with previous Voopoo pod mods like the Argus, Argus Pro, Argus X, Drag Max, Drag X &
        Drag S. Likewise, the 510 adapter allows the Drag 3 to be used with all PnP tanks.
